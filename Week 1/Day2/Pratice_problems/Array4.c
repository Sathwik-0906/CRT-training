// To find the sum of all "leader elements" in an array.

// ðŸ’¡ What is a Leader in an Array?
// An element is called a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right.

// For example, in the array [52, 66, 64, 36, 45, 24, 32]:

// 66 is a leader (greater than all to its right)

// 64 is a leader

// 45 is a leader

// 32 is a leader
